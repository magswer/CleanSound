## General Info  :musical_keyboard:
***
 Landing page development for a musical instrument company that plans to sell its flagship product: an electronic drum kit. 
 <p>The objective is to make a replica of the design of the landing page proposed by the client with the priority that the user can interact with the drumkit, in such a way that when he clicks on each of the "pads" a different sound is emitted.</p>
